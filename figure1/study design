In the present study, all GD patients were recruited from the Hainan Provincial People's Hospital, Haikou, China. The subjects’ basic information (gender, age, BMI, smoking, and alcoholism) and clinical indexes were recorded in Table S1. They were divided into 3 groups including the methimazole treatment group (GA, n=8), the methimazole+black-bean treatment group (GB, n=9), and the methimazole+probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum) treatment group (GC, n=8), all subjects stayed on their treatment for 6 months (Fig 1). The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hainan Provincial People's Hospital (2018-109), and informed consent was obtained from all volunteers in written form before they were enrolled in the study. Sampling and all described subsequent steps were conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines. Blood samples were collected monthly, while the fecal samples were collected from each subject at baseline, 3 months and 6 months after treatment. For each Graves’ disease patient, their fecal and blood samples were collected by a doctor during their clinical visit. After the weight of the fecal materials was determined, a sample protector (CW0592M, CWBIO, China) was added at a ratio of five-to-one to the sample to stabilize nucleotides. The samples were stored at -20 °C until further processing.
